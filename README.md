# 🌐 LangGraph

LangGraph is a powerful framework for building **stateful, multi-agent applications** powered by language models. It extends LangChain by allowing developers to define **graph-like flows** between different components, tools, or agents — enabling more control, memory, and decision logic in complex workflows.

## 🚀 Features

### ✅ 1. Graph-Based Control Flow
- Define **nodes** (steps) and **edges** (rules for what comes next).
- Useful for loops, branches, and conditional logic with LLMs.

### ✅ 2. Multi-Agent Support
- Easily build **multi-agent systems** where agents can talk to each other, pass data, or collaborate.
- Each agent can have its own memory, tools, and logic.

### ✅ 3. Stateful Execution
- Keep track of **conversation history** and **intermediate states** across the workflow.
- Enables advanced reasoning tasks and dynamic decision-making.

### ✅ 4. Integration with LangChain
- Built on top of LangChain — reuses chains, tools, memory, and agents you already use.
- Makes LangChain workflows smarter and more flexible.

### ✅ 5. Easy to Visualize and Debug
- Graph structure is **easy to understand**, visualize, and test.
- Great for designing and maintaining complex LLM applications.

## 🧠 Use Cases

- Multi-step question answering  
- Autonomous agents with feedback loops  
- Task orchestration with dynamic routing  
- Agent collaboration (e.g., researcher + coder agents)
